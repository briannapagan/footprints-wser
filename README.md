# Climate Change Impacts to the Western States Edurance Race Course

In collaboration with Footprints, an incubator for climate action, we have created an interactive map that shows the ongoing effects of climate change on the WSER course. 

Join us Wednesday June 21st at Alpenglow Sports in Tahoe for a run and to have a discussion about how we can protect the trails we love.
